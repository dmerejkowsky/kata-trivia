1. Let's try to run it (install python2 first)

2. It works, but the messages contain typos

3. Cosmetic changes

4. Run poetry init to add black and pytest

5. Let's keep the log in a test - does not work because of
   random

6. Let's checkout the 'reference' folder from upstream

7. HAHA - now we can write a test if we manage to have
  trivia.py use reference/randomSeq.txt

8. `def main()`

9. We need a class that has the good APIs and can read stuff from a predefined sequences, time for classic TDD
